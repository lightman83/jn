    "# Getting Started\n",
    "This section is how to get started setting up a development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1. Install Linux\n",
    "Linux is the prefered OS for doing any sort of hacking. Depending on the hardware available there are several flavors that are popluar and available. Because of the proliferation of instructions that reference the `apt` package manager debian/ubuntu derivatives are perhaps the best options. I am writing this document on Linux Mint 19.1, which is a derived from Ubuntu. Once installed make sure you have the most recent packages installed, perform the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "apt update && apt upgrade -y\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2. Install compiler\n",
    "Linux is a UNIX like operating system, and sometimes you have to build software from source code. Some distros automatically install a compiler for you, and some don't. To be sure, perform the following. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "sudo apt-get install build-essential -y\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3. Install Current Python\n",
    "The Python programming language is a must have. For some reason Linux distros rarely have the latest version of Python, and are usually 1 or 2 minor versions behind what is current. To further compicate matters a binary package of Python is not available for Linux from the Python site, so you will have to build it yourself. Luckliy you've installed the compiler already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python likes to say the \"batteries are included\", meaning it does a lot out of the box. This also requires that there are some development libraries installed first.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev \\\n",
    "    libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is important for things like ssl and reading input from the command line. Python will still compile without the libraries, but it will not be as powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to do is compile and install:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.2/Python-3.7.2.tgz\n",
    "tar xzf Python-3.7.2.tgz\n",
    "cd Python-3.7.2\n",
    "./configure --enable-optimizations\n",
    "sudo make altinstall\n",
    "```\n",
    "**make altinstall** is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file /usr/bin/python. This way you can be sure that you aren't disrupting any of the system software that depends on the distribution version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A quick note about virtual environments\n",
    "If you are using the most current version of Python then out of the box you have access to one of the best features of any programming language available, Virtual Environements. Sometimes to extend the features of Python you have to install new packages, like to access a database, or perform cryptographic operations on data. If you install the package into the global installation of Python it becomes available to all programs running Python, but problems can occur when you have Python programs that require different versions of a package. Virtual Environments are a method of handling package conflict. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m venv my_env\n",
    "source my_env\\bin\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4. Setup Git\n",
    "Git is the ubiquitous version control tool used for open source, but it is more than a source control tool. The reasons for why you need it are too numerous to list. Just make sure it is installed and configured for you to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"John Doe\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be sure to use your own name and email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5. Install a good Code Editor\n",
    "All programmers have their own preference for this. Install yours. If you have multiple, install them all.  I am not going to suggest one to anyone, ever. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have absolutely no idea then these are the instructions I follow when installing the one I use.\n",
    "[Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have little experience in editing code I would suggest trying some different editors. Be sure to explore the key shortcuts and other features. After time you will learn what your preferences are. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 6. (Optional) Install other Languages\n",
    "At this point you have a C compiler and Python available, and this might be all you need. However, there are other useful languages that may come in handy. I always have the following just in case:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mono** - This is open source .NET. If you have .NET Framework libraries you want to use you will need this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **.NET Core** - Microsoft has put a lot of effort into making a true platform independent version of .NET. At this time I would not call it a mature platform, but it is gaining ground on Mono.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Java Development Kit** - Java is a superb platform independent development environment with a steep learning curve, however it is very \\*NIX friendly. Most linux distros come with a version of OpenJDK installed. This may be good enough, but I usually go find the Oracle version and install it. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ruby** - This used to by my scripting language of choice, but it has lagged far behind Python in adoption by other programmers. I usually only install it at the time when it becomes required, which is almost never now. I still have some libraries written in ruby that I sometimes use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
